  gender: "male",
  mobile: "1234567890",
  aadhaar: "123456789012",
  aadhaarVerified: false,
  pan: "ABCDE1234F",
  panVerified: false,
  joinDate: "January 15, 2023",

  ]
}
```

### Features Implemented:
- User registration with data validation

- Navigation updates with user name

### Files Modified:

- index.html - Added logout button
- styles.css - Styled logout button
- TODO.md - Updated progress tracking

## Testing Checklist:
- [x] User registration creates account correctly
- [x] Login validates credentials properly
- [x] Profile data populates from user account
- [x] Session persists across page refreshes
- [x] Logout clears session properly
- [x] Error messages display for invalid credentials
- [x] Responsive design maintained

- [x] Mobile number validation functions
- [ ] Email field validation and storage
- [ ] Aadhaar number validation and OTP verification
- [ ] PAN number validation and OTP verification

- [ ] Buy/sell trade capabilities

## Next Steps:
1. Implement email field in signup and profile
2. Add Aadhaar verification with OTP
